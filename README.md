# Quick Sort Algorithm

This repo contains implementations of the quick sort algorithm in JavaScript, Python and C.

Additionally, `2d-sort/2d-sort.c` sorts a two dimensional array based on the value of the first element.

`js-implementation/quick-sort.js` creates new `left` and `right` arrays for each recursive call. Another version of the algorithm, `js-implementation/quick-sort-in-place.js` sorts elements in place for improved space complexity. To avoid allocating additional memory, the C implementations use this sort in place approach.
